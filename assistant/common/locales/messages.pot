"    Ensure all tool calls satisfy schema requirements, modifying the messages payload in-place.\n"
"\n"
"    The \"messages\" param is a list of message payloads.\n"
"\n"
"    ## Schema\n"
"    - Messages with they key \"tool_calls\" are calling a tool or tools.\n"
"    - The \"tool_calls\" value is a list of tool call dicts, each containing an \"id\" key that maps to a tool response\n"
"    - Messages with the role \"tool\" are tool call responses, each with a \"tool_call_id\" key that corresponds to a tool call \"id\"\n"
"    - More than one message can contain the same tool call id within the same conversation payload, which is a pain in the ass\n"
"\n"
"    ## Tool Call Message Payload Example\n"
"    {\n"
"        \"content\": None,\n"
"        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n"
"        \"tool_calls\": [\n"
"            {\n"
"                \"id\": \"call_HRdAUGb9xMM0jfqF2MajDMrA\",\n"
"                \"type\": \"function\",\n"

"                    \"arguments\": {},\n"
"                    \"name\": \"function_name\",\n"
"                }\n"
"            }\n"
"        ]\n"
"    }\n"
"\n"
"    ## Tool Response Message Payload Example\n"
"    {\n"
"        \"role\": \"tool\",\n"
"        \"name\": \"function_name\",\n"
"        \"content\": \"The results of the function in text\",\n"
"        \"tool_call_id\": \"call_HRdAUGb9xMM0jfqF2MajDMrA\",\n"
"    }\n"
"\n"
"    ## Rules\n"
"    - A message payload can contain multiple tool calls, each with their own id\n"
"    - A message with tool_calls must be followed up with messages containing the role \"tool\" with the corresponding \"tool_call_id\"\n"
"    - All messages with \"tool_calls\" must be followed by messages with the tool responses\n"
"    - All tool call responses must have a preceeding tool call.\n"
"\n"
"    Returns: boolean, True if any tool calls or responses were purged.\n"
